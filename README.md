# DRY testing of @Autowired @Services using a proxy 

## premise

When testing spring boot applications with [serenity-bdd](http://www.thucydides.info/) I tried multiple approaches, three in more details below.

Given is a pretty basic service with three business functions. The goal it to create a BDD report on the tests of these functions.

    public interface MyService {
      void authenticate(String name);
      boolean isAuthenticated(String name);
      void logout(String name);
    }
      
## experiments
### step library
Following the [documentation on step libraries](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/theserenitybook/latest/step-libraries.html) and [spring testing](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-documentation/blob/master/src/asciidoc/spring.adoc) it is easy to use these in your tests like

    class MyServiceSteps {
    @Autowired MyService myService
    
      void authenticate(String name) {
        myservice.authenticate(name)
      }
      // TODO repeat for the other methods
    }
    
    class MyserviceTest() {
      @Steps MyServiceSteps myServiceSteps
    }
      
As you can see, the drawback here is that you have to duplicate every service method as step.

### screenplay
This has the same drawback, you have to duplicate the service as performables.

    // TODO create performables for the other methods
    class Authenticate implements Performable {
      public void <T extends Actor> performAs(T actor) {
        UseTheService.as(actor).getService().authenticate(actor.name, actor.token);
      }
    }
        
### call the service directly
Using the @Autowired instance directly works, but does not show up in the BDD reports

    class MyServiceTest {
      @Autowired MyService myService;
      
      public void whenAuthenticating() {
        myService.authenticate(actor.getName(), actor.getToken);
        actor.should(seeThat(a -> myService.isAuthenticated(actor.getToken), is(true));
      }
    }
        
## workaround
I was able to find a compromise between being DRY, readable tests and reporting on the steps using a proxy. By introducing a common interface `api.MyService` one can intercept the methods called and convert them to instrumented performables so the steps are reported. Also the connection to the actor is maintained well IMHO. See the example [ServiceTest](https://github.com/globalworming/spring-service-testing-serenity-screenplay/blob/master/src/test/java/com/example/demo/service/MyServiceImplIT.java), [UseTheService.as(actor).getService()](https://github.com/globalworming/spring-service-testing-serenity-screenplay/blob/master/src/test/java/com/example/demo/screenplay/abilities/UseTheService.java#L32) and [StepReportingProxy](https://github.com/globalworming/spring-service-testing-serenity-screenplay/blob/master/src/test/java/com/example/demo/screenplay/abilities/StepReportingProxy.java)

    Test Suite Started: My service impl test
    TEST NUMBER: 1
    STARTING STEP client uses the service to authenticate client
    FINISHING STEP
    STARTING STEP client uses the service to logout client
    FINISHING STEP
    STARTING STEP Then answer if is authenticated should be (false)
      STARTING STEP client uses the service to is authenticated client
      FINISHING STEP
    FINISHING STEP
    TEST NUMBER: 2
    STARTING STEP client uses the service to authenticate client
    FINISHING STEP
    STARTING STEP Then answer if is authenticated should be (true)
        STARTING STEP client uses the service to is authenticated client
        FINISHING STEP
    FINISHING STEP
